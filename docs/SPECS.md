## Switch Module

I purchased this [switch](https://www.amazon.com/AEDIKO-Channel-Optocoupler-Isolation-Support/dp/B095YFJ69T/ref=sr_1_3?crid=15HB2NNA6RIGE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.TfkA8ZQecaZp3sRAFR1T-k6Dz6syi7R5_xtUkMQfGo77MReahVDtMZHJ_otV-GBivFxxsKykOc0Aq1Z-eB0h7OUg2c9un7OhUkn4ZX1qpLibKH_EcgSo2BbFlsfYIvqtHc4lmQuIDnti3EctSQZlgjtwKk_5FUKuZkd4YytjgXE4TubjOaKWAbHXmXgtJRqTVaUuAtf9XSV9CfRKO_S8gLCtnxeSihtG_CizD0ujedo.U8VGiiQvQFDS03d5kWrBabWXDQR0hqyoB5T53gz4tGc&dib_tag=se&keywords=relay%2Bmodule&qid=1737308935&sprefix=relay%2Bmod%2Caps%2C959&sr=8-3&th=1), it was inexpensive and it seemed to exceed the minimum specs that I need. At the inexpensive cost, I think it's worth giving it a shot. 

## Contact Relay Module

It was inexpensive and seems durable. I also like that it has a casing around the wire that it comes from. There was one cheaper, but this seems more durable and slightly more visually appealing.
