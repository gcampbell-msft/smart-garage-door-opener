# Smart Garage Opener

## Goals 
- Create a wifi enabled or bluetooth enabled garage door opener that is able to integrate with Home Assistant. 
  - Detect the state of the garage door.
  - Control the garage door remotely.
- Refresh my memory about various computer engineering concepts. 

## Materials

- 1 [Magnetic Reed Switch](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCYHBKVF?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- 1 [NodeMCU ESP8266 12-F](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QXHWLTJ?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1)
- 1 [3v3 Relay](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XGZSYJV?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- 1 uF capacitor
- 1 small breadboard
- [Jumper wires](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTT31CBC?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)
- [22 guage wire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TX6BX47?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title)


## Components Schematic and Layout

TODO: Insert diagrams of the schematic of the circuits and the layout of the circuits, possibly include pictures. 

## Journey and roadblocks

TODO: Maybe sublink to a .md file in the docs folder.

## Future work

- Create packaging for the microcontroller and wiring. 
- Investigate relocating the smart garage door opener to on top of the garage door opener, rather than the attic. This will be cleaner and mitigate wire usage.
